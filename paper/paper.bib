	abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of fully automated panoramic image stitching. Though the 1D problem (single axis of rotation) is well studied, 2D or multi-row stitching is more difﬁcult. Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence in order to establish matching images. In this work, we formulate stitching as a multi-image matching problem, and use invariant local features to ﬁnd matches between all of the images. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the input images. It is also insensitive to noise images that are not part of a panorama, and can recognise multiple panoramas in an unordered image dataset. In addition to providing more detail, this paper extends our previous work in the area (Brown and Lowe, 2003) by introducing gain compensation and automatic straightening steps.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we use two approaches to solve the Perspective-Three-Point (P3P) problem: the algebraic approach and the geometric approach. In the algebraic approach, we use Wu-Ritt’s zero decomposition algorithm to give a complete triangular decomposition for the P3P equation system. This decomposition provides the first complete analytical solution to the P 3P problem. We also give a complete solution classification for the P3P equation system, i.e., we give explicit criteria for the P3P problem to have one, two, three, and four solutions. Combining the analytical solutions with the criteria, we provide an algorithm, {CASSC}, which may be used to find complete and robust numerical solutions to the P3P problem. In the geometric approach, we give some pure geometric criteria for the number of real physical solutions.},

	abstract = {A basic problem in computer vision is to understand the structure of a real world scene given several images of it. Techniques for solving this problem are taken from projective geometry and photogrammetry. Here, the authors cover the geometric principles and their algebraic representation in terms of camera projection matrices, the fundamental matrix and the trifocal tensor. The theory and methods of computation of these entities are discussed with real examples, as is their use in the reconstruction of scenes from multiple images. The new edition features an extended introduction covering the key ideas in the book (which itself has been updated with additional examples and appendices) and significant new results which have appeared since the first edition. Comprehensive background material is provided, so readers familiar with linear algebra and basic numerical methods can understand the projective geometry and estimation algorithms presented, and implement the algorithms directly from the book.-- Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {Over the past 25 years, optical remote sensing has been developed into a very useful tool for sampling the nearshore environment, principally through the use of Argus Stations. However, the capabilities of such systems as scientific tools depend on an understanding of the physics of the camera as an optical sensor (including a detailed knowledge of accuracies and resolution) and of the relationship of optical signals to the geophysical signals they represent. This paper describes the components of Argus Stations with an emphasis on quantitative characterization of the accuracies and resolution of system components. Algorithms for estimation of a range of important nearshore measurements are discussed and their accuracies and ground-truth test results referenced. References to a number of key examples of Argus-based contributions to the scientific literature are cited. Since Argus technology serves as the basis for the {CoastView} Program, the technical capabilities described below are part of the foundation of {CoastView} sampling.},

The repository contains scripts that perform end-to-end georectification of oblique imagery from land-based multi/single-camera stations or stationary Unmanned Aircraft Systems ({UAS}). The toolbox produces georectified frames, ensemble statistical products, and subsampled pixel collections for optical wave, current and bathymetric inversion analyses. While experts have employed similar scripts operationally for years, this toolbox is for photogrammetry novices. Illustrative example scripts with demonstrative data teach fundamentals and can be easily transitioned to operational processing.},
